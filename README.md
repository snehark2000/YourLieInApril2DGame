I have worked on a 2D-Platformer game for Game Programming course in college. The project was entirely developed using Unity game engine. It's a pixel art game set up based on a Japanese series 'Your Lie in April'. The game design for this project includes various components like Rigidbody 2D, Collider, Audio Source, Tilemaps and Cinemachine.  Basically, in the game, the player uses arrow keys for movement and looses a life when he hits an Enemy. The player can destroy the Enemy by jumping on them. If the player reaches the goal point, he progresses to next level.
